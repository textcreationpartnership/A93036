            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will ſeeme ſtrange to thee, to receive any tydings of me from France; as it did appeare miraculous to mee, to heare the ſtate of all affaires in England from thee by the laſt Poſt, that intelligence I hope will hope, if you care to direct and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it, ſo that it may meet no interception. I would not write back to you by the ſaid meſſenger, leſt my letters might have arrived ſooner at London to the Parliament, than to thee at Oxford, and ſo fortunately encountring a man of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> at Paris, where I am now, who brought me ſome Expreſſes from his Maſter out of the Weſt of England; I thought beſt by him, both for the ſecuritie and ſuddenneſſe of the conveyance, to ſend back by him an anſwer of thy former letter, and my true reſpects to thee my deare <hi>Will,</hi> whom ſince my departure I have ſtill worne about my heart.</p>
            <p>I am exceeding glad that his Sacred Majeſtie is ſo well and ſtrongly ſeated (as I am enformed he is) at Oxford, and hope his Councell will adviſe him there to continue, till all the turbulent buſineſſe of the times be reduced to an happy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155688:3"/> period, I hope, and ſo does all the reſt of his ſervants here, who ſuffer in his Majeſties cauſe, that Hee will not want ſtrengths at home to ſettle Him in his wonted Royaltie at White-Hall, where wee had all rather be attending his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon in our former garb and greatneſſe, than live here like Honourable Exiles at Paris; for that is (truſt mee) the beſt account the French men make of us.</p>
            <p>Concerning the managing your domeſtick affaires, and the proſecution of the preſent war in England, it were a needleſſe preſumption for me to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dventure on adviſing you. I know his Majeſtie hath ſo many able head-pieces about Him, that were I there preſent, I ſhould blame my modeſty, ſhould I intrude mee on any counſell in the directing thoſe affaires, which certainly had my ſucceſſe anſwered my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, or my power my will, had by the courſe I ſhaped, been at far more ſetled rate than now they are, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie had never been driven to theſe ſtraights, nor the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments endevours ſucceeded ſo proſperouſly. But they were blaſted in the bud of their expectation and progreſſe, and ſo no more can be ſaid of them; but that were like too early fruit, eaſily ſhaken downe to earth, and there betrayed to rottenneſſe.</p>
            <p>For the ſervices which my ſelfe, and others of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſters here in France, under the umbrage of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, have endevoured in the advancement of His Majeſties preſent wars; I ſhall give thee a ſhort and reall account, ſuch as may befit the integritie of my heart to the King, and my affection to thee my friend. I have for mine owne part, having by reaſon of the Queens commends, and the intereſt of my former acquaintances beſt credit in this Court, employed my whole ſtudies to ingage the King of France to the ſuccours of the King our Maſter, as I have by former letters adviſed thee. But during the life of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who for what cauſe I know not, was ſtill adverſe to my proceedings, my ſuits and endevours were caſt againſt the wind, and ſo vaniſhed. Since his deceaſe, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155688:3"/> have found my addreſſes in that buſineſſe, and eaſilier enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both by his Majeſty of France and his Councell, who notwithſtanding by a politike pretenſion of conſerving the league inviolable between the Kingdomes of England and France, have waved my deſires ſo, that have not ſuted to ſo full an effect as I aimed them. I find this Nation flexible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, I meane the great ones of it, to give eare attentively to the King our Maſters wants and ſufferings; but when I urge them home for a ſupplement to thoſe wants, with a complementall courteſie they anſwer; They could heartily wiſh the differences between his Majeſty and Parliament were fairly compoſed, and that to work that compoſition, they would willingly engage their King to employ his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt powers; but ſtill with that clauſe, Saving the amitie between our Kingdome and the Kingdome of England: ſo that verbally I may define, ready to ſerve the King, but cordially the Parliament, which hath ſo much afflicted me, and diſcompoſed my little patience, that I have often in plaine termes intimated to them, the great diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it would caſt upon the dignitie of Kings in generall, to bee forced to ſtand to the arbitrements of their ſubjects, they have anſwered me flatly, they underſtood not how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went between the King of England and his Parliament, whom they believed to be far better inſtructed in the lawes of the Kingdome and the prerogative of our Kings, againſt which, it was not likely they would attempt any thing, then they which were ſtrangers. And-when I requeſted there might be ſome ayds of men and ammunition ſent over by the King of <hi>France,</hi> as teſtimonies of his love to his Majeſtie of <hi>England,</hi> they have replyed, that with all their hearts they would be yeelding to the transferring any ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, but that they did believe their King could not in his wiſdome, conſidering his pregnant neceſsities, being ingaged in ſeverall parts of his Dominions againſt the powerfull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> tranſmit any of his ſoldiers as auxiliaries hither, ſince he was ſcarce furniſhed with men enow to keep
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155688:4"/> the field and maintaine his frontier garriſons againſt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie, that ſo many ways infeſted, every part of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> wearyed &amp; diſheartned with theſe circumſtantiall delayes, which were indeed flat denyalls. I was reſolved to ceaſe any further proſecution of that buſineſſe, determining with my ſelfe to reſt my ſelfe here in a quiet baniſhment; and ſince I could no other way advantage his Majeſties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, as much as I would by my prayers, till now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe late dayes: the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanyard</hi> both tyred with the tedious expences of their precedent wars, began to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſome treaty and overture of peace, which if it be once (as I hope it will be ratified between them) I ſhall not doubt to procure his Majeſty very conſiderable ayds out of theſe parts. To facilitate the effecting of which, I have ſpared no paines, no diligence, nor omitted any coſt which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my abilities, to the favorites and Minions of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to endeare their Maſter to the King our Maſters aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I have remonſtrated to them the many indignities which have been offered to his Majeſtie, his royall Conſort, their Kings ſiſter, and all their royall Progenie, by expelling them from the Court at <hi>White-hall,</hi> ſince which time, her Majeſty hath beene forced to live in the manner of an exile in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at the <hi>Hagne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I laid before them the many ſtraits and grievous exigents which the King our Maſter was brought into by the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Subjects, being deprived of his revenue and magazines, and how acceptable ſuch ſupplies of his preſent wants would arrive to him, and in what an eternall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friendſhip it would indeare his Majeſty to the King and State of <hi>Franch</hi> to receive ſuch demonſtrations of their aptitude to his reliefe, as were men and ammunition.</p>
            <p>Many other motives, ſuch as either my wit or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Kings preſent affaires could prompt mee to, did I intimate unto them; by all which I thinke (for I have no aſſurance but imaginary, on which I can build no certainty)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155688:4"/> I have won ſo much on the King of <hi>France</hi> and his Councell, to intend ſome ſuccour to the King our Maſter: For ſince that time, Ships fit for ſervice have been ſtayed in all the ports of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> and the adjoyning parts; choyce of all the able Mariners made for manning the ſaid veſſells; ſtore of harneſſe and millitary proviſion ſent to the forementioned parts, and the moſt ſignall Commanders in <hi>France</hi> commanded to give their attendance thereabouts: 15000. well experienced ſoldiers being provided for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe Ships, whither they are bound is not yet divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but the rumour goes for <hi>England,</hi> which if it be ſo, and that they can get ſafe landing there, and joyne with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties preſent forces, wee may then aſſuredly hope the beſt, and that his Majeſty will be victorious over all his enemies.</p>
            <p>But in troth, deare <hi>Will,</hi> wee can but onely flatter our ſelves with theſe hopes, as men doe which with it ſhould be ſo, but not affirme it ſo; many pregnant reaſons indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me to thinke the contrary, as the infallible knowledge the State of <hi>France,</hi> of the prevailing power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forces and their ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, where the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are no wayes ſo good ſouldiers as they are at land, nor to be held comparable to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who now are reported here, to guard the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and the narrow Seas.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it may be a fine tricke of <hi>French</hi> policy, whileſt the <hi>Spanyard</hi> is amazed with the preſent overture of peace to beat him at his owne weapon (craft) to provide this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and theſe ſouldiers in ſtore for the ſuccour of the King, ſo to have them in readineſſe upon all occaſions (which are not unlikely to fall out) of breaking of this treaty of peace, to fall upon the <hi>Spanyards</hi> townes in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or to ſet forth for the invaſion of ſome other of his Dominions at the approach of the Spring, till when, they cannot be rigged nor in readineſſe to ſet out; ſuch trickes there are frequent in the actions and policies of State, but wee hope the beſt; and if theſe proviſions be really intended for the aſſiſtance of his Majeſty, I ſhall thinke my inforced diſcontinuance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155688:5"/> from my Countrey and friends fortunate, ſince by it I have beene an inſtrument to promote his Majeſties peace: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, my kind <hi>Will,</hi> I wiſh with all my heart matters had never proceeded to this unluckie heighth betweene his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Parliament, then had wee enjoyed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers company in peace at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and theſe miſeries never been inflicted on our owne unhappy Countrey, where, ſo all matters were fairly compoſed betweene his Majeſty and the Parliament, I could heartily wiſh my ſelfe in my former condition, that I might be happy in the ſociety of thy ſelfe and all my other friends, to whom I deſire thee to doe my beſt commendations; and as my laſt <hi>Encaric<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mento,</hi> and ſo of moſt conſequence to be performed, I deſire thee to let his ſacred Majeſtie know, that I proſtrate my life at his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feet, wiſhing no longer to enjoy life, then I ſhall ever ſtrive to be eſteemed his Highneſſe humbleſt and loyalleſt Subject and ſervant, and thy true friend,</p>
